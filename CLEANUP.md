# Project Cleanup Documentation

This document explains the cleanup performed on the InternMatch project to streamline development and maintenance.

## Database Migrations Cleanup

### Removed Files
- `combined_migrations.sql` - Replaced with comprehensive full_migration.sql
- `combined_migrations_updated.sql` - Replaced with comprehensive full_migration.sql
- `direct_migration.js` - Replaced with apply_full_migration.js
- `apply_migrations.sh` - Replaced with apply_full_migration.sh
- `apply_migrations.bat` - Replaced with apply_full_migration.bat
- `run_migrations.ps1` - Replaced with apply_full_migration scripts

### New Files
- `supabase/migrations/full_migration.sql` - Complete database setup in one file
- `apply_full_migration.js` - Node.js script to apply the full migration
- `apply_full_migration.sh` - Unix shell script wrapper
- `apply_full_migration.bat` - Windows batch script wrapper
- Updated `DATABASE_SETUP.md` with new instructions

## Unused Components Cleanup

### Removed Components
- `src/components/ui/SkillsInput.tsx` - Component was not used in the project
- `src/components/admin/StudentResume.tsx` - Component was not used in the project

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Simplified Database Setup**
   - Single comprehensive migration file
   - Easier to understand database schema
   - Streamlined database setup process

2. **Reduced Code Complexity**
   - Removed unused components
   - Cleaner codebase with less technical debt
   - Improved maintainability

3. **Better Documentation**
   - Clear instructions for database setup
   - Documentation of cleanup actions

## Future Recommendations

1. **Regular Code Cleanup**
   - Periodically scan for unused components
   - Remove deprecated features

2. **Database Migration Strategy**
   - For future changes, consider adding migrations incrementally
   - Update the full_migration.sql file with each change
   
3. **Component Usage Tracking**
   - Consider implementing a component usage tracker
   - Automatically identify unused components
